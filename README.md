Femcare is a web-based application. It connects patients with specialist doctors and health counsellors across 10+ specialities like Gynaecology, Dermatology, Psychology, Nutritionist and General medicine, etc. Patients also have an option to keep all their medical records digitally saved and can access them anywhere anytime. Our mission is to provide high-quality healthcare access to women.

## Problem Statement
"Healthcare accessibility isn‚Äôt a privilege to women
- it is a basic need and should be a priority‚Äù

Nowadays women are at par with men in all spheres of life, they are working as
successful doctors, engineers, professionals, entrepreneurs etc. Women do not feel free
to talk about their health. In some cases it becomes life-threatening. Talking about
women related health issues is still a big taboo in most parts of India. Participants are
required to find a technical solution to solve the above problem.
